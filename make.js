Many of the components involved are not commercially available and would have to be custom engineered. Even just an AR display by itself would be an almost insurmountable challenge to create. Many genius with PhD’s in optics have tried and failed to invent a compact near-eye volumetric display. </p> <p>It may be difficult, but I don’t think it’s impossible to build a compelling AR system. This page discusses some of the components and variables necessary to consider for AR. It is in no way exhaustive: for example it doesn’t even begin to cover input methods. However, if you are interested in building an AR system, I hope this page gives you an idea of what factors need to be considered. </p><h2 style="text-align: center">Depth Sensors</h2>	<br><br><h3> Infared Structured Light </h3>	<h3> Time of Flight </h3><h3> Lidar </h3><h3> Triangulated </h3><h3> Depth from Defocus </h3><h3> Coded Aperture </h3><h2 style="text-align: center">SLAM/Features</h2><h2 style="text-align: center">Displays</h2><h3> Depth </h3>	<h3 style="text-align: center"> Light Field Displays<h3> Field of view </h3><h3> Resolution </h3><h3> The semi-transparent flying elephant in the room <h3>	<h2 style="text-align: center">Chips</h2><h2 style="text-align: center">Graphics</h2><h1 style="text-align: right; cursor: pointer" onclick=" jsGoToPage(\'marketplace\'); scroll(0,0)">Chapter 5:</h1>				<h2 style="text-align: right; cursor: pointer" onclick=" jsGoToPage(\'marketplace\'); scroll(0,0)">Marketplace </h2> 			</div>'
