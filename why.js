If you want to watch a live sports game, you turn on your TV. (if you are like many Americans, you have a separate TV in your living room and your bedroom). If you want to get work done, you open your laptop. If you have a white collar job, you probably have a corporate supplied desktop that does all the same things your laptop does. If you want to read a magazine or look at photos on Facebook, you flip to your tablet. If you want to do any of those tasks while away from home, you’ll probably do it on your smartphone. Paradoxically, each device does essentially the same thing, yet a single device would never suffice.</p> <p>The number of screens we own keeps increasing, with diminishing marginal utility for each new screen. In the 1980’s most people didn’t own a computer. In the 1990’s, most people didn’t own a laptop. In the 2000’s most people didn’t own a smartphone. Today, it wouldn’t be unusual for a person to own two televisions, a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, a smartphone, and a smartwatch. In the 12X13 room I am writing this in, there is a desktop, two laptops, two smartphones, a tablet, a smartwatch, and an Xbox connected to a projector. All of these devices are essentially being used to access the same digital media, whether it is games, music, TV shows, tweets, powerpoint presentations, or web services. </p> <p>Augmented Reality has THE POTENTIAL to consolidate every screen into a single device. If engineered and implemented properly, an AR headset could simulate your TV when you’re home, your desktop when you’re at work, your phone when you’re shopping for groceries, and every device in between. You wouldn’t have to worry about what to carry around when, because AR can easily adapt to your environment. </p> <p>Don’t let me lead you to believe that the main vision of AR is to lessen the number of devices you have to carry. To the contrary, augmented reality could be the biggest revolution in how humans interact with computers since the 1973 invention of the graphical user interface. AR could blur the line between what is real and what exists in cyber space and could transform how we interact with our environment. With AR you could conjure an object out of thin air, change the color of that ugly couch your husband loves, morph your living room into your favorite video game, tour a building that hasn’t been built yet (or was destroyed hundreds of years ago), or be two places at once. I can’t tell you AR’s killer application, because it probably hasn’t been thought up yet. When the iPhone was first announced, no one imagined it would be used for Uber or Tinder.</p> <h1 style="text-align: right; cursor: pointer" onclick=" jsGoToPage(\'ux\'); scroll(0,0)">Chapter 2:</h1> <h2 style="text-align: right; cursor: pointer" onclick=" jsGoToPage(\'ux\'); scroll(0,0)">Designing the AR <br> User Experience</h2> </div>'
